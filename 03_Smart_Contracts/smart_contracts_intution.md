## **Ethereum and Smart Contracts**

<br>

#### **Decetralized Autonomous Oraganizations (DAOs)**
As, we know inside any organization, the workload and authorities are classified on a hierarchical basis. These divided entities has
their set of protocols which they follow which results in the proper working of that organiztion. This protocols are mentioned in their
contract. Now, taking the same concept in the world of Cryptocurrency, we can create an organiztion where people don't have to do this
and the above mentioned functioning will be done by the program (or smart contract) which in turns automate the task. So, if we provide
the protocols with the help of smart contract (by coding the logic), what we will get wil be DAO.

#### **DAO attack - Soft Forks and Hard Forks**
During the DAO attack on the DAO organization that crowdfunded the money, the concept of forks came over. Due to some error in the
code of smart contract the hacker was able to exploit the blockchain, as we know the smart contract is the one that governs the
blockchain.
So, in order for the situations like that, there was a failsafe in the system that even after the transaction the payment cannot be
withdrawed for 30 days. So, in these 30 days some of the people came to a decision of `Hard Fork`, i.e., to change the rules of the
contract and to revert the money back since it was a huge amount (50 - 60 million dollars). But, some of the people don't agree with
the fact that we are tampering with the immutability property of the blockchain, even with the power of majority. So, the main ethereum
blockchain split off into the another branch. The miners who continue mining on the original branch were now part of `Ethereum Classic`.
So, this hard fork happens on the block number 1919999 in the main ethereum chain.
There was also the case where the bitcoin accepted segregated witness but that happen as a `Soft Fork` and that happened on the block
number 476768. So, there was no splitting branch in this case due to the soft fork even though there were people who were against the
segregated witness. Those people suggested that we should increase the block size to 8mb but majority goes with the segwit option.
Then, after sometime, those opposing people decided to increse their block size in place of upgrading to the segwit protocol and hence
at the block number 478558, the bitcoin splits into the `bitcoin cash`. After a few time later, some people were in against of the use
of ASICs, so they hard forked at the block number 491407, to make the blockchian ASIC resistant and hece the `bitcoin gold` is created.

Now, as for the case of Ethereum DAO attack even though the money got revereted back on the original chain since that same initial
money goes down to the classic chain, the same mony should be present there, but since they had not adopted the reverting scheme,
the hacker still gets the ethereum classic money. This is because when we see the money in a chain, we see the history of the chain
which includes the state of the chain before splitting off.

_The Thumb Rule is_:

> Hard Forks = Loosen up Rules

> Soft Forks = Tighten up Rules

Now, as we know for the case of hard fork of bitcoin, it changes into bitcoin cash. So, the hard fork loosen up the rules by letting
them expand the block size from 1MB to 8MB. In this there are groups who have upgraded and the group who haven't upgraded. In this
the backward compatibilty is not present. However, for the soft fork this doesn't happens as everybody has to upgrade sooner or
later. In this we can consider an example where we are reducing the block size and hence tightening up the rules. In this the
backward compataility is present.


#### **Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)**
We have IPOs and ICOs. IPOs is an `Initial public offering` and it's a way that companies have been historically used to raise money
from the stock market. An IPO works as follows, say a person wants to raise some money for their company, so at the start they put
the work that can be some intial capital into the company before any IPO is even considered yet. Then they produce some products and
gain profits. Then, they want to list the company publicly so the shares are available to the general public, they conduct an IPO
in which the public give them money and they give them shares.
Now, how an ICO works is as follows, say a founder creates a company they invest their work and labour and capital and then at some
time they think to raise some more capital, they need more money to scale their idea and business. So what they do is that, they put
their idea in a enclosed environment and then they will introduce a coin (token) realted to that idea or product which will have
price money attached with them and are going to be used for buying their companies product. So if the people see the value in having
these tokens, so what they gonna do is to invest the money in that tokens in an ICO and in return they will get token and also all
the shares will be left with the founder or company itself.


#### **Blockchain and Web 3.0**
As we know, the Web 2.0 is the introduction of multimedia with interactive and responsive webpages. Web development as two faces -
the front end and the back end. With the transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 the front end of the websites changes drastically but
the back end interaction of the nodes with server remains same as a centralised network. So, the change of Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 is
the change that occurs in the back end, that is the change of centralised network interactions into the decentralised network
interactions.
Consider the example of now, when people are interconnected to each other on the internet. So, whenever we use a platform for
connecting to each other we first have to connect to their servers which act as an intermediate for us to connect with the other
person on the net. However the underlying principle remains the same that we are using a centralised network to interact, so they
have control over our data and privacy and the charges they can apply. Whereas, in the Web 3.0 the blockchain approach the idea is
that we can have an direct interconnectivity and have blockchain that can run the application for us and one copy of it will be
stored at every computer.
